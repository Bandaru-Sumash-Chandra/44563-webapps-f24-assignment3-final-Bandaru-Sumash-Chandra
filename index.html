    <h2>Rome</h2>
    <p>Rome is a city I admire for its incredible 
       blend of <b>ancient history</b> and <b>contemporary life</b>. Walking through its streets feels 
        like a journey through time, with historic monuments and ruins sitting alongside modern cafes and
        shops. The local cuisine and lively markets add a unique charm to the city, making every
          corner a place to explore. The diverse culture and warm <b>hospitality</b> of its people
           create a welcoming atmosphere that always leaves me feeling enriched and inspired.</p>
